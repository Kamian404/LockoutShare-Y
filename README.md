## What is lockout sharing?
Lockout Sharing in World of Warcraft allows multiple characters or players to benefit from the same raid lockout.
A player with a saved lockout can invite others to their group.

## Example:
If the 9th boss drops a mount, the sharer invites you to a lockout where the first 8 bosses are already killedâ€”you join and directly kill the 9th boss.
The host does not need to be present, making the process automatic.
 
## Commands:
- !sharing: The Player who whispered you will be invited
- !lead: The Player who whispered will be promoted to lead after he entered the instance
- !leave: The Player who whispered you leaves the queue
- !normal or !nhc (default): Sets the difficulty to normal
- !heroic or !hc: Sets the difficulty to heroic
- +: This command will free the sharer
